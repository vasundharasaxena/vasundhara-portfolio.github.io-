In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict hotel cancellations based on booking details. By analyzing a variety of factors such as lead time, customer type, room type, and special requests, the model helps hotels anticipate cancellations and optimize bookings. I employed techniques such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in cancellation behavior. The final model, implemented using logistic regression and decision trees, was fine-tuned for accuracy and deployed using Flask for real-time prediction. This solution can assist hotels in improving resource management and reducing revenue loss due to last-minute cancellations.

In this project, I performed a detailed analysis of London’s bike-sharing data to understand usage patterns across different times and locations. The analysis focuses on uncovering trends in bike ride duration, peak hours of usage, and popular routes. I utilized various data visualization techniques to illustrate the influence of factors such as weather conditions, weekdays versus weekends, and station proximity on bike usage. The insights drawn from this project can help city planners optimize bike-sharing services and improve urban mobility solutions for commuters. The project was built using Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
